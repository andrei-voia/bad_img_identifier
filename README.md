# Bad Image Identifier

A program that can search for a list of bad image formats that you do not want to be in a set of data that you plan on using in very specific purposes like training a graph for a machine learning algorithm.

## How the code works

This code does the following:
* Returns the number of files
* Returns the number of images
* Splits the images by their type and shows how many of each are
* Returns the number of bad images
* Shows the name of the bad images and changes their name to be easily found in the future
